variable| Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory. Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.| https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm
functions| Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.| https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions
parameter| Parameters are part of a function definition (def or lambda)y, var-keyword| http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/08/arguments-and-parameters.html
argument| Arguments are part of a function call. There are four different kinds of arguments: positional: Arguments without a name, keyword: Arguments with a name, packed positional: An iterator preceded by *, packed keyword: A mapping preceded by **.| http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/08/arguments-and-parameters.html
dictionary| It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.| www.
tuple| A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.| https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
module| A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the modules name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.| https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html
lists| A list in Python is an ordered group of items (or elements). It is a very general structure, and list elements don't have to be of the same type: you can put numbers, letters, strings and nested lists all on the same list.| https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Lists
while_loops| his is our first control structure. Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there. Control structures change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run. As a side note, decision statements (e.g., if statements) also influence whether or not a certain statement will run.| https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Loops
true| Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.| https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html
numbers| Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types, means that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.| https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_numbers.htm
pickle| module implements a fundamental, but powerful algorithm for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. Pickling is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and unpickling is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream is converted back into an object hierarchy.| https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html
Classes| Compared with other programming languages, Pythons class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a method can call the method of a base class with the same name.| https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html
filters| As the name suggests, filter creates a list of elements for which a function returns true.| http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html
